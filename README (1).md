# Face Recognition Attendance System





## Abstract
In the era of modern technologies emerging at rapid pace there is no reason why a crucial event in educational sector such as attendance should be done in the old boring traditional way.
Attendance monitoring system will save a lot of time and energy for the both parties students as well as the class teachers. Attendance will be monitored by the face recognition algorithm by recognizing only the face of the students from the rest of the objects and then marking them as present. The system will be pre feed with the images of all the students and with the help of this pre feed data the algorithm will detect them who are present and match the features with the already saved images of them present in the database

## Introduction

The purpose of the attendance monitoring system using face recognition is to ease the attendance process which consumes lot of time and efforts; it is a convenient and easy way for students and teacher. The system will capture the images of the students and using face recognition algorithm mark the attendance in the sheet. This way the class-teacher will get their attendance marked without actually spending time in traditional attendance marking.
The identification process to determine the presence of a person in a room or building is currently one of the routine security activities. Every person who will enter a room or building must go through several authentication processes first, that later these informationâ€™s can be used to monitor every single activity in the room for a security purpose. Authentication process that is being used to identify the presence of a person in a room or building still vary. The process varies from writing a name and signatures in the attendance list, using an identity card, or using biometric methods authentication as fingerprint or face scanner.
